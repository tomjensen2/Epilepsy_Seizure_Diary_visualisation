## A python project for visualising epilepsy seizure diary data:
This code uses iPyWidgets to interactively plot seizure diary data in a heatmap format where data is imported from .csv files output by the When-did-I app.

You can bin seizure counts by day, week or month, and see the time of day dependence of seizures as well as a histogram of seizure counts.

Medication dose changes are switchable and similarly times for taking rescue medication can be easily viewed.

I'm starting to add some analysis and import of apple watch sleep data for future reference
